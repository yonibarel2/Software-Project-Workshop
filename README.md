# Software Project Workshop  

## 📝 Overview  
This project explores implementing clustering algorithms in **C** and **Python** with a focus on the **C-Python API** and integration with **NumPy**.  
Algorithms implemented:
- **K-Means Clustering** (C & Python)
- **Symmetric Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF)** (coming soon)

## 📌 Status  
This repository will include **2 parts**.
Currently, only **Part 01 – K-means Clustering (C & Python)** is available.  
Parts 02 will be added after completion of the final project.
