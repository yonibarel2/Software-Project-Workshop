# Software Project Workshop  

## 📝 Overview  
This project explores implementing clustering algorithms in **C** and **Python** with a focus on the **C-Python API** and integration with **NumPy**.  
Algorithms implemented:
- **K-Means Clustering** (C & Python)
- **Symmetric Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF)** (coming soon)

## 🎯 Main Goal  
Demonstrate how clustering algorithms can be implemented efficiently in **C** and exposed to **Python** via the **C-Python API**, leveraging **NumPy** for data handling.  
The project aims to show both low-level performance and high-level usability by combining C speed with Python flexibility.

## 📌 Status  
This repository will include **2 parts**.
Currently, only **Part 01 – K-means Clustering (C & Python)** is available.  
**Parts 02 - Symmetric Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF)** will be added after completion of the final project.
